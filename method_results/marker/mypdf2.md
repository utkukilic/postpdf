## What Is A Business Report?

In a business report, you will analyze a problem or a need within the business and make recommendations for a solution or a course of action. 

The report will contain various sections, so section headings should be used. Business reports may also contain visual representations of data such as graphs, charts, or tables. 

The following sample is an *internal* business report, meaning the audience consists of 

![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)

those from within the business. 

*This sample paper was adapted by the UAGC Writing Center from an original paper by a *student. Used by permission.*
1 In the **introduction**, the purpose for the report and the recommendations for action should be stated.

## 2 Sunco **Utilities Partnership Internal Business Proposal**

Specific statement findings.

The current U.S. power grid is decentralized, and its electricity, whether it is petroleumsourced, nuclear-sourced, or generated from wind and solar power, is distributed on an undifferentiated basis. Therefore, it has become very difficult or impossible for our customers to choose renewable energy sources as the sole means for powering their properties. This proposal seeks to provide a way that Sunco can accomplish the goal of "renewable power by choice" through active partnerships with utility companies and regulators across the country.

Recommendation for action.

Executive Summary Through partnering with utility companies and other energy regulators, Sunco can make renewable energy a dependable option for our customers. The timeline, costs, and recommendations are provided in this report. 

The **Executive** 
Summary section should include a concise summary of the business report. 

Essentially, this section should (a) 
restate the purpose of the report, (b) 
highlight the major points of the report, and (c) describe any results, conclusions, or recommendations from the report.

Opportunity In the absence of a national "smart" grid, which would increase "pricing transparency, as well as enable a host of consumer-producer interactive transactions" (Contreras, 2012, p. 645), we here at Sunco, as producers of renewable energy, have run into the problem of getting our services to the customers who demand them. Similarly, our consumers who generate renewable energy on-site from solar panels and wind turbines have also run into the problem of permits, regulations, and service charges that vary from state to state and utility to utility (Ryor, 2014). Currently, the main challenge is convincing local utilities of the economic viability of renewable energy, and since the energy supplied is undifferentiated, the general customer base is unaware that other options exist.

## Solution

Since we, as a company, lack the necessary knowledge and authority to enable our services to be accessed and expedited in a way that would make them economically feasible in the existing system, we seek to engage in a partnership with utilities and regulators around the country to grant our clients exclusive, contractual "renewable energy options." These options will standardize and simplify contracting processes and fees for our "behind-the-grid" customers and require utilities to offer renewable energy alternatives to our "on-the-grid" customers. Of course, the on-the-grid renewable energy the utilities offer their customers will be supplied by Sunco. 

In return for these waivers, we will offer to finance energy efficiency renovations for their customers' (our customers') homes, which would include weatherizing and sealing, the installation of smart appliances and meters, and use the energy savings generated from these improvements to repay the loan and give the remaining 50% of the savings to the utility and customer to split. So, our customers will not only get the renewable energy they want and the savings at the meter but will also get the updated information systems they will need to optimize their energy use in the future. The utilities will benefit by the lessening of demand on their plants not only through employing our renewable energy resources as an option for their customers but also by decreased consumption at the meter from smart technology (Friedman, 2008). This initiative will increase our company's market share and change the dynamic of the energy industry as a whole since regulators will no longer be giving incentives to utilities for the unlimited power they deliver, but instead for the power they save.

## Our Qualifications

![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)

Since Sunco is in good standing with local lending institutions due to our ongoing expansions, we can secure prime finance rates for these renovation loans. We are also experienced in providing installation services for our customers if contractors are not available. We have been supplying renewable energy off the grid for 15 years, and we are familiar with all processes and procedures regarding solar and wind power regulations. 

| When possible, include a timeline of your  proposal in your business report.   |

## Timeline

Our plans are to gradually phase into the national electricity grid by securing extended contracts with utilities that allow us to supply renewable energy in their areas of operation. The general timetable is as follows:
1. Immediately: Find utilities nationwide that are agreeable to our partnership plan 2. Within 1 Month: Advertise our services nationwide on a multimedia platform 3. Within 1 Year: Provide nationwide clean energy service via the grid and home-based solar and wind power installations 4. Within 5 Years: Operate our clean energy generation systems from a fully integrated smart grid that allows for customers to buy and sell energy on an energy internet so as to access the cheapest energy sources at any one time and maintain full interface with energy companies and utilities Costs The chart below illustrates the estimated total savings per month for a customer who receives energy efficiency renovations in the form of:
- One smart refrigerator

- One smart electricity meter
- Weather sealing of windows and doors

| The costs associated with your proposal are also important  to include. Create a chart or some form of visual  representation of the costs when possible.   |

Estimated average energy savings for residential customers each month

| Month         | January   | February   | March   | April   | May   | June   | July   |
|---------------|-----------|------------|---------|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| Prior Year    | $135      | $130       | $120    | $110    | $115  | $125   | $140   |
| Present       | $80       | $75        | $70     | $60     | $70   | $80    | $90    |
| Total Savings | $55       | $55        | $50     | $50     | $45   | $45    | $50    |

| Numerate lists when describing  steps of a process  or providing a  timeline of events,  as shown here.   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

This data means a $1000 energy improvement loan for the above products and services could be repaid in two years at 20% interest figuring the average power savings per month at $50. We believe that an investment of $1000 to $2,000 would be adequate to "energy renovate" most dwellings to the degree that power savings would be substantial. 

## Conclusion

To solve the problems of waste and environmental pollution that our current electrical grid creates and to better service our customers and the power consuming public at large, a new system must be implemented. The first step in this process will be the creation of a national, centralized electrical grid that offers viable alternatives to traditional oil, coal and nuclear power generation. For this new grid to function, it will require two-way communication between customer and supplier so energy efficiency can be optimized and environmental impact minimized.

The first phase of this goal is for us, as a company, to overcome the biases and opinions in the industry that renewable energy is "expensive" and "unrealistic." The demand for clean energy exists today and will increase as our customers come into possession of the smart technology that will make it possible. With this business plan for renewable energy options, we can expedite the formation of the smart grid and position ourselves as leaders in the clean energy marketplace.
