### 1. Introduction

Sandro Mereghetti IASF-Milano, INAF,
via A.Corti 12, Milano, 20133, Italy sandro.mereghetti@inaf.it I review the properties and discuss some of the puzzling aspects of the unique binary system composed of the luminous hot subdwarf HD 49798 and a white dwarf with mass of 1.2 M⊙ and spin period of 13.2 s. This is one of the few massive white dwarfs with a dynamically measured mass and the one with the shortest spin period. It emits pulsed X-rays with a very soft spectrum, powered by accretion from the tenuous stellar wind of its companion of sdO spectral type. The current level of mass accretion cannot provide enough angular momentum to explain the small, but precisely measured, spin-up rate of 72 nanoseconds per year, which is instead best interpreted as the result of the radial contraction of this young white dwarf. The higher mass transfer rate expected during the future evolutionary stages of HD 49798 will drive the white dwarf above the Chandrasekhar limit, but the final fate, a type Ia SN explosion or the collapse to a millisecond pulsar, is uncertain.

The bright blue star HD 49798 first attracted the interest of astronomers in the sixties owing to the peculiarities of its spectrum with prominent helium and nitrogen lines and showing radial velocity variations, which indicated the presence of a companion star 1. It was also noticed that its high galactic latitude (b=19◦) implied a distance above the Galactic disk unusually large for a main sequence OB star.

A few years later, radial velocity measurements 2confirmed the binary nature of HD 49798 with the discovery of its orbital period (1.55 days) and the determination of the mass function (0.27 M⊙). However, no spectral or photometric signs of a second star could be found, implying a faint low mass companion, such as a red dwarf or, possibly, a white dwarf. In 1994, the optical mass function was measured with higher precision 3(0.263±0.004 M⊙), but all the attempts to reveal the invisible companion of this single-lined spectroscopic binary were unsuccessful.

The mystery of the companion star was solved, at least partially, when soft Xray emission with a highly significant periodicity at 13.2 s was discovered 4from the *ROSAT* source RX J0648.0–4418, positionally coincident with HD 49798. This rapid periodicity can only be explained by the rotation of either a neutron star
(NS) or a white dwarf (WD). In both cases, the expected optical emission from these compact stars is much fainter than that of the much larger star HD 49798, and thus very difficult (or impossible) to be seen in optical photometric or spectral data.

Renewed interest in the HD 49798/RX J0648.0–4418 binary was prompted by

the measurement of the X-ray mass function, obtained through the timing analysis of the X-ray pulsations. This led to the determination of the masses of the two binary components, MHD = 1.50 M⊙ and MX = 1.28 M⊙ for the subdwarf and its companion, respectively 5. As discussed in Sec. 4, there are now several arguments indicating that the companion of HD 49798 is a massive WD, with interesting implications for the future evolution of this system (Sec. 5).

### 2. Properties Of Hd 49798

HD 49798 (also known as CD-44 2920) is a bright blue star (B−V=−0.27) with apparent magnitude mV =8.27, located in the southern sky (R.A.= 6h 48m 4.7s, Dec.=−44◦ 18′ 58.4′′, J2000). Early estimates indicated a distance of 650 pc, while the recent measurements obtained with Gaia 6 give d=521±14 pc. Despite the slight downward revision of its distance, HD 49798 is still the most luminous known subdwarf of O spectral type (sdO), with an absolute magnitude of MV =−0.24 and a bolometric luminosity of 4.4×103 L⊙.

A first application of non-LTE atmospheric models to the spectrum of HD 49798 yielded an effective temperature of T*ef f* = 47500±2000 K and a surface gravity logg = 4.25±0.2. The overabundance of helium, that equals hydrogen in number
(XH=0.19 and XHe=0.78), was also confirmed 7.

More recently, accurate values for the element abundances and for the stellar parameters of HD 49798 were obtained with the analysis of high-resolution optical and UV spectra 8(see Table 1 for some of these parameters). Note that the HD 49798 mass derived from this atmosphere modelling is consistent with the dynamically determined value.

A particularly interesting property of HD 49798, in view of the X-ray emission from this binary, is the presence of a radiatively driven stellar wind, as it is clearly indicated by the P-Cygni profiles of nitrogen lines 9. The most recent estimates 8, that take into account the peculiar abundances of HD 49798, give a mass loss rate of 2.1×10−9 M⊙ yr−1 and a wind terminal velocity vw=1570 km s−1. This wind provides the matter that produces the accretion-powered X-rays from the compact star. In addition, the stellar wind is also responsible for the X-ray emission from HD 49798 itself 10, which is clearly visible, with a luminosity LX ∼ 2×1030 erg s−1, only when the hot subdwarf eclipses the much brighter X-ray flux emitted by its compact companion. The relevance of HD 49798 in the context of the study of the weak winds of early type subdwarfs 11 is discussed in Ref. 12.

### 3. X-Ray Properties

X-ray emission from the direction of HD 49798 was seen for the first time with the *Einstein Observatory* in March 1979, but the small number of counts in the HRI instrument (0.05-4 keV) prevented a detailed analysis. The source was later observed with the *EXOSAT* satellite, but the detection in the CMA instrument was severely contaminated by the strong ultraviolet emission from HD 49798.

A substantial advance came with a *ROSAT* observation carried out in 1992, when the data of the PSPC instrument revealed a very soft X-ray source with flux of ∼ 8 × 10−13 erg cm−2s
−1(0.1-2 keV), periodically modulated at 13.17 s 4. The fast pulsations, clearly resulting from the rotation of a compact star, unequivocally indicate that the system contains a NS or a WD. The poorly constrained spectral parameters derived with the PSPC were consistent with a large luminosity range, from ∼ 1032 to more than 1036 erg s−1. Although it was not possible to distinguish between the NS and WD case based on the X-ray luminosity, the presence of a coherent periodicity, which makes the system equivalent to a double spectroscopic binary, opened the possibility to obtain the masses of the two components.

This was done thanks to a long *XMM-Newton* pointing, carried out in May 2008, that was accurately scheduled to include also the orbital phase of the expected Xray eclipse (never covered in previous X-ray observations). The X-ray pulse delays induced by the orbital motion (giving the projected semi-major axis of the pulsar aX sini = 4.2 R⊙) and the duration of the eclipse (giving the system inclination 79◦ *< i <* 84◦) were measured 5. The derived value of MX=1.28±0.05 M⊙ was still consistent with both possibilities. However, based on the X-ray luminosity of 2×1031 erg s−1, now well constrained by the good quality spectrum, the interpretation in terms of a massive WD was preferreda. Updated system parameters, derived from a phase-connected timing analysis of ROSAT, *XMM-Newton* and *NICER*
observations spanning almost thirty years 13 are summarised in Table 1. They are aThe same accretion rate onto a NS would give a luminosity higher by a factor RWD/RNS ∼ 300.

slightly different from those obtained in previous works 5, mainly as a consequence of the revised distance. In fact, the updated value of the radius of HD 49798 leads to a higher inclinationb, but main implications related to the masses of the two stars do not change significantly.

The time derivative of the spin period is negative 14, i.e. the WD is spinning-up at the very small, but remarkably steady rate of 72 ns per year 13. In fact, such a small spin-up rate could be measured only by phase-connecting over almost 30 years all the available X-ray observations. The implications of the source spin-up rate are discussed in Sec. 4. A search for the 13.2 s periodicity in the optical band 15 gave negative results. The X-ray pulse profile is energy-dependent, as shown in Fig. 1.

Below ∼0.5 keV it has a single broad peak, with a pulsed fraction of ∼60%, while above this energy it shows two peaks with a smaller pulsed fraction.

Also from the spectral point of view it appears that the X-ray emission from RX J0648.0–4418 consists of two different components 14,16. The lower energy range is dominated by a soft, thermal-like emission, well described by a blackbody with temperature kT = 31 eV (3.6×105 K) and radius of emitting region RBB=41 km, while a power law with photon index Γ=1.9 and 0.3-10 keV flux of 1.3 × 10−13 erg cm−2s
−1 dominates above 0.5 keV (Fig 1). The X-ray spectrum was also fitted 16 with a WD atmosphere model specifically computed for the surface gravity of this bThe system inclination is derived from the observed duration of the X-ray eclipse (4311±52 s)

and the known radius of the subdwarf.

4 massive WD and the composition of HD 49798 (this is the expected composition of the atmosphere, because the WD is accreting matter from the subdwarf's wind). This model describes well the soft spectral component, with a best fit with effective temperature T*ef f* = 2.2 × 105 K. However, the limited bandwidth and energy resolution of the available data did not allow us to obtain a univocal solution. In fact, only slightly worse fits were obtained with T*ef f* = 2.9 × 105 K and T*ef f* = 3.7 × 105 K. The most interesting result of this analysis is that the size of the emission region inferred with the WD atmosphere model (∼1600 km, ∼400 km, and ∼66 km, for the three values of T*ef f* ) are much larger than that obtained using a simple blackbody to describe the thermal emission.

The soft X-ray emission is modulated near the eclipse ingress and egress by the absorption caused by the wind material (Fig. 2). These variations can be well modelled by adopting the correct composition of the wind 8. Contrary to the typical behaviour of accretion-powered X-ray sources, the X-ray luminosity has remained at the same level in all the observations, except for a small flux variation (less than a factor two) in the power law component, in data taken 6 years apart 16.

### 4. White Dwarf Or Neutron Star?

Both a NS and a WD are compatible with the measured mass and spin periodc of the compact companion of HD 49798. The main arguments to discriminate between the two possibilities are based on three properties: i) X-ray luminosity, ii) spin period evolution *iii)* size of X-ray emitting region.

While initial estimates of the X-ray luminosity were affected by the uncertainties on the distance and on the spectral parameters, the accurate Gaia parallax and the high quality *XMM-Newton* spectrum13,14, imply a precise value of LX =
(1.3 ± 0.3) × 1032 erg s−1. Given that the radius of HD 49798 is much smaller than that of its Roche-lobe (RRL ∼3 R⊙), accretion onto the compact object can occur only through capture of the stellar wind. In this case we can estimate an accretion rate of M˙ = (RA/2a)
2 M˙ w, where a= 7.8 R⊙ is the orbital separation and RA is the Bondi-Hoyle accretion radius. The latter depends on the relative velocity between the wind and the accreting object, v = (v 2 w + v 2 orb)
1/2 ∼ vw. If this matter reaches the surface of a star with mass M and radius R, we expect a luminosity

$$L_{\mathrm{X}}={\frac{G M}{R}}\,{\frac{R_{\mathrm{A}}^{2}}{4a^{2}}}{\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{w}}={\frac{(G M)^{3}}{R\ a^{2}\ v_{w}^{4}}}{\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{w}}$$
M˙ w (1)
Taking M˙ w = 2 × 10−9 M⊙ yr−1, vw = 1500 km s−1, and radii of 3000 km and 12 km, respectively in the WD and NS case, Eq. 1 gives LWD
X = 1.2 × 1031 erg s−1 and L
NS
X = 3.0×1033 erg s−1, These luminosities are, respectively, lower and higher than the observed value.

However, the presence of a rotating magnetosphere that interacts with the accreting plasma can lead to more complex scenarios yielding different luminosities 18.

As discussed in detail in Ref. 13 and illustrated in Fig. 3, a reduced NS luminosity, consistent with the observed value, can be attained only in the sub-sonic propeller regime and if the NS has a magnetic field of ∼1011 G. However, in this regime a pulsed fraction much smaller than the observed one is expected and, more importantly, it is impossible to explain the spin-up. On the other hand, in case of a WD,
Eq. 1 gives a luminosity in agreement with the observed one for a wind velocity vw ∼ 800 km s−1. Although this values is smaller than the terminal wind velocity inferred from optical/UV studies (see Table 1), it is possible that the wind velocity close to the WD is reduced due to the photoionisation produced by the X-ray emission 19.

A WD interpretation is also favoured by the time evolution of the spin period.

Compact objects in X-ray binaries experience spin-up due to the angular momentum carried by the accreting material. However, both in the NS and WD case, the accretion rate in this system is too small to produce the observed spin-up rate, ca period of 13.2 s, although the fastest observed in a WD, is still a factor ∼3 larger than the break-up value for such a massive WD17.

6 even in the most favourable condition of accretion through a diskd. Also the great stability of the spin-up rate over three decades, is at variance with the irregular variations typically seen in the period derivatives of wind-accreting systems. A
solution of this puzzle is naturally provided if the compact object is a relatively young WD, still in the radial contracting phase 20. The change in the moment of inertia for a WD of 1.2 M⊙ and age between one and five millions of years gives a spin period time derivative in full agreement with the observed one. Such a range of WD ages is consistent with the evolutionary scenarios proposed to explain this binary system (see Sec. 5).

To discriminate between a WD and a NS, one can also consider the size of the emission region derived from the spectral fit of the soft spectral component, although this is clearly a model-dependent inference. The blackbody model gives a radius of ∼40 km, while fits with a WD atmosphere model yield much larger radii
(Sec. 3). These dimensions are too large for a hot spot on the surface of a NS, but are reasonable values in the WD case.

dThe conditions for the formation of a disk are not satisfied in this system, therefore the angular

![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)

momentum accreted by the compact object is lower than the maximal value.

### 5. Evolution

The low H abundance indicates that HD 49798 is the stripped core of an initially much more massive and larger star. Also the N overabundance and the low abundances of C and O confirm that its surface layers once belonged to the outer part of the H-burning core of a massive star. Slightly different evolutionary scenarios have been proposed to explain this system, that clearly passed through a common envelope phase.

HD 49798 could be the descendent of a fairly massive progenitor that began to fill its Roche-lobe before He ignition and is currently in a core He-burning phase 7,21. The mass of the He star can then be related 22 to that of its progenitor by MHe=0.043 M1.67, implying an initial mass of ∼8 M⊙. Alternatively, HD 49798 could consist of a degenerate CO core, surrounded by a helium envelope with a He-burning shell at its base 23. In this scenario, it would be the core of a progenitor of ∼5 M⊙ that suffered mass loss during a common envelope event when it was on the early asymptotic giant branch. Both scenarios imply that the WD in this system is much younger than those found in cataclysmic variables.

Also the future evolution of this system, in which a massive WD is accreting He-rich material, is interesting and it has been discussed by several authors. The current mass transfer onto the WD is not changing significantly its mass, but it will greatly increase when, about 65,000 yrs from now24, HD 49798 expands and fills its Roche-lobe. This will produce a high X-ray luminosity, possibly with the presence of bright outbursts and the formation of a super-soft X-ray source, and also possibly leading to important variations in the WD mass.

Evolutionary computations 25 indicate that the WD will reach the Chandrasekhar limit after only a few 104 years of Roche-lobe overflow, during which
∼(5–6)×10−6 M⊙ yr−1 of He-rich matter are steadily converted to C and O, while the unburned matter is ejected by the system trough an optically thick wind. The final fate of the WD depends on other critical factors such as, e.g., its composition and final rotational velocity.

If HD 49798 hosts a CO WD, it could be the progenitor of an over-luminous type Ia supernova, since the fast rotation can increase the mass stability limit above the value for non-rotating stars. Massive WDs are expected to have an ONe composition, but again the high spin might play a role here, since it can lead to the formation of CO WDs even for high masses 26. The fact that this system originated from a pair of relatively massive stars (∼8–9 M⊙) might suggest that it could be the progenitor of a type Ia supernova with a short delay time. However, the delay time might be considerably longer if the explosion has to await that the WD spins down 27.

Considering its high mass, it is more likely that the companion of HD 49798 is an ONe WD. In this case an accretion-induced collapse might occur, leading to the formation of a NS. The high spin rate and low magnetic field make this WD an ideal progenitor of a millisecond pulsar. This evolutionary scenario could provide an alternative path for the direct formation of millisecond pulsars, not involving the recycling of old pulsars in accreting low-mass X-ray binaries.

The future evolution of this system in the case that the compact object is a NS
has been explored in Ref. 24. According to these authors, HD 49798/RX J0648.0– 4418 could pass in a phase of high accretion rate appearing as an ultra luminous X-ray source 28, and then produce either a binary or an isolated millisecond pulsar.

### 6. Fast Rotation And Magnetic Field

The companion of HD 49798 is the WD with the shortest spin period currently known. A few other fast rotating WDs have been discovered in recent years (see Table 2). All of them are in cataclysmic variables, old systems in which the WD has been spun-up during a long phase of disk accretion. On the other hand, the origin of the rapid rotation of the HD 49798 companion is unclear. HD 49798/RX J0648.0– 4418 is a young system, originating from intermediate mass stars, that passed through a common-envelope phase 22. The current transfer of angular momentum is very small. Unless the WD was directly born with a short period, the spin-up must have occurred either before or during the common envelope phase. Given the short duration and complex dynamics of this phase, it is more likely that the spin-up occurred when the subdwarf was close to fill its Roche-lobe, just before the ensuing of the common-envelope phase and with the formation of an accretion disk.

If the accretion disk extends down to the star's surface, as it is expected for a weakly magnetised WD, short periods can be easily reached thanks to the high specific angular momentum carried by the accreting matter. Interestingly, some indication on the strength of the magnetic field can be derived considering the constraints illustrated in Fig. 3 for the different regimes of interaction between the rotating magnetosphere and the surrounding plasma. As discussed in Refs. 5,13, the strong X-ray pulsations and the observed luminosity imply a magnetic dipole field below a few 103 G, otherwise the WD would be in the propeller state. If the WD magnetic field was so weak also during the phase of rapid spin-up due to (near)
Roche-lobe accretion, it should have been spun up to a period even shorter than the current one.

### 7. Conclusions

Many binaries composed of a WD and a hot subdwarf of B spectral type are known 38,39, but no accretion powered X-rays have been detected in these systems 40–43. Thus, HD 49798/RX J0648.0–4418 is the only known accretion-powered X-ray binary in which the mass donor is a hot subdwarf. Furthermore, both components of this binary do not share the typical properties of their respective classes:
the WD is particularly massive and has a high spin frequency (though it is weakly magnetic), the hot subdwarf has a high luminosity, a relatively low surface gravity and peculiar abundances. These properties make HD 49798/RX J0648.0–4418 particularly interesting, not only in the context of stellar evolution models, but also for the study of hot subdwarfs and WDs in general. For example, it is possibly the first observed example of a young WD still in the phase of contraction. It is also a laboratory to investigate the weak stellar winds of hot subdwarfs, since the orbiting WD acts as a probe of the wind properties. Future multi-wavelength observations can bring very useful information and help to solve some of the still open questions, such as, e.g., the origin of the fast spin and the peculiar spectral/timing properties of the X-ray emission. In a more distant future, the presence of a fast rotating massive WD might also lead to the detection of gravitational waves caused by asymmetries in the mass distribution caused by accretion or by magnetic deformation 44.
