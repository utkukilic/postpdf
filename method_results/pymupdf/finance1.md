### The Cash Flow Statement – Structural overview


###### Cash Flow Statement (CFS)

 Net Income + Depreciation/Amortization +/- Increases/Decreases in Current Liabilities +/- Decreases/Increases in Current Assets
 Cash from operating activities (CFO)

 - Capital Expenditures (Capex) +/- Sales/Purchases of other assets
 Cash from investing activities (CFI)

 +/- Issuance/Redemption of short/long term debt
 - Payment of preferred/common dividends
 - Share repurchases
 Cash from financing activities (CFF)

 NET CASH FLOW



##### • Main CFS components:
 CFO, CFI and CFF.
###### Supplementary notes might be added to the CFS.

##### • Changes in non-cash net
 working capital:
###### Increases in current assets/decreases in current liabilities are uses of cash. Decreases in current assets/increases in current liabilities are sources of cash.

## Financial Statement Analysis - Ratios

###### • Ratios based on the financial statements provide an insight
 into the financial performance of a company. They can provide a
 benchmark or relative performance target for decision taking.



###### • Depending on the perspetive, the respective users of financial
 information prioritize the relative importance of the observed ratios differently: the management might primarily focus on operating performance and growth oriented ratios, whereas lenders might primarily track liquidity and risk related performance ratios.

 • Ratios should always be put in context, e.g. relative to internal changes
 or to industry competitors and the overall economic development.



###### • The main intention is to identify areas for further analysis in order to
 understand underlying issues and to project future developments.

### Financial Ratio Analysis – Operating Performance



##### •

 •
 •


##### The asset and equity turnover ratios provide an overview with respect to the operating efficiency of a company. They should be considered in the context of the respective industry. Although high ratios are typically desired, there are  ade  offs between optimizing the ratios and potentially neglecting asset investments to support future sales growth – or – a change in the capital structure can improve a ratio without the actually desired effect on performance.

## Operating Activity – Liquidity Ratios

###### Liquidity is a key concern for the viability of a company. High liquidity ratios are typically preferred (e.g. by creditors), however, they can
 also expose weaknesses in management/investing processes.


##### Cash Ratio

## Operating Activity – Cash Conversion

###### Aim to reduce the time required to convert invested capital back into cash. Although low cycle values are typically desired to reduce net working capital,
 there are potential trade-offs, e.g. between credit terms/AR and sales.

### Financial Ratio Analysis – Operating Profitability


##### Net Sales
 - Cost of Goods Sold (CoGS)
 Gross Profit
 - Operating Expense (SG&A, etc.)
 Operating Profit (EBIT)

 - Interest Earnings before tax (EBT)

 - Tax Net Income (NI)


##### Gross Profit Gross Profit_
 = Margin Net Sales


##### Operating EBIT_ Profit Margin [=] Net Sales


##### Net Profit NI_
 = Margin Net Sales



###### •

 •


###### General objective to achieve high margins (production and operating efficiency),
 on a sustainable basis relative to respective industry competitors.
 In order to conservatively assess the future profitability it is important to only
 consider income from continuing operations.

## Growth rate and DuPont-Analysis (ROE)



###### •

 •


###### The attainable growth rate of a company can be approximated by the return on equity (ROE) and the retention rate (RR); g = ROE*RR, whereby the RR = (1- payout ratio) = ( 1- dividends/net income) DuPont Analysis: Breaking ROE (= NI/Equity) up in individual components.
 (note: use end-of-year equity, rather than averages)


##### Profit Asset Leverage
 ROE = x x
 Margin Turnover (Equity Multiplier)


##### Net Income_ Sales _ ROE = x
 x Sales Assets


##### Assets _
 Equity


##### Calculate the ROE and compare the result if the
 debt-to-asset ratio changes +/- 20%

## Limitations to financial ratio analysis

###### • Financial ratio analysis is limited by several factors. The analysis is
 dependent on the quality of the underlying financial data (so adjustments
 might be required to obtain a fair picture of the facts) and the information should always be seen in context of the general business cycle, industry cycle, developments, practices and sensitivities to seasonality, firm specific changes, the type of the business and its products or services, etc.



###### • Financial ratio analysis can help to identify sources of weaknesses.
 However, the application always needs to consider the „bigger picture“. Simply aiming to maximize a ratio without being aware of potential trade offs can be counter-productive with respect to other objectives. For
 instance, aiming to reduce working capital with the objective to minimize financing costs can cause sales and profitability to decline as the credit terms might constrain competitiveness.
