The following pages show what a patent application should look like. This is the format
of what your application should follow for filing.

A nonprovisional utility patent application must include a specification, including a description
and a claim or claims; drawings, when necessary.

The specification, including the abstract and claims, must have lines that are 1.5 or double-spaced
in a single column of text. The text must be a nonscript font (e.g., Arial, Times Roman, or
Courier), preferably with a font size of 12. Handwritten text scanned into PDF format is not
acceptable.

The specification is a written description of the invention and of the manner and process of
making and using the invention that concludes with the claims to the invention, which must begin
on a new page. The specification must be in clear, full, concise, and exact terms to enable any
person skilled in the art or science to which the invention pertains to make and use the same.

|In this section, the invention must be explained along with the process of making and using the invention in full, clear, concise, and exact terms. This section should distinguish the invention from other inventions and from what is old. It should also describe completely the process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or improvement invented. In the case of an improvement, the description should be confined to the specific improvement and to the parts that necessarily cooperate with it or that are necessary to completely understand the invention. It is required that the description be sufficient so that any person of ordinary skill in the pertinent art, science, or area could make and use the invention without extensive experimentation. The best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out the invention must be set forth in the description. Each element in the drawings should be mentioned in the description.||
