* The **asset and equity turnover** ratios provide an overview with respect to the **operating efficiency** of a company.
* They should be considered in the context of the respective industry.
* Although high ratios are typically desired, there are -

offs between optimizing the ratios and potentially neglecting asset investments to support future sales growth - or - a

change in the capital structure can improve a ratio without

the actually desired effect on performance.

# Operating Activity - Liquidity Ratios

Liquidity is a key concern for the viability of a company.

High liquidity ratios are typically preferred (e.g. by creditors), however, they can also expose weaknesses in management/investing processes.

Operating Activity - Cash Conversion

\(\bullet\) Aim to reduce the time required to convert invested capital back into cash.

\(\bullet\) Although low cycle values are typically desired to reduce net working capital, there are potential trade-offs, e.g. between credit terms/AR and sales.

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Cash & Av. Acc.Rec. & Average & Av. Acc. Pay. \\ Conversion & = & Collection & + & Inventory & - & Payment \\ Cycle & & Period & Period & Period \\ Cash & & 365 & 365 & 365 \\ Conversion & = & acc. receiv. & + & inventory & - & acc. payable \\ Cycle & & turnover & turnover & turnover \\ Cash & & 365 & 365 & 365 \\ Conversion & = & (net sales/ + & (CoGS/ & - & (CoGS/ \\ Cycle & & Av.

# Financial Ratio Analysis - Operating Profitability

Net Profit

Net Sales

General objective to achieve high margins (production and operating efficiency),

on a sustainable basis relative to respective industry competitors.

In order to conservatively assess the future profitability it is important to only consider income from continuing operations.

* [12] The attainable growth rate of a company can be approximated by the return on equity (ROE) and the retention rate (RR); **g** = ROE*RR, whereby the RR = (1- payout ratio) = ( 1- dividends/net income)
* [13] DuPont Analysis: Breaking ROE (= NI/Equity) up in individual components. (note: use end-of-year equity, rather than averages)

# Limitations to financial ratio analysis

\(\bullet\) Financial ratio analysis is limited by several factors. The analysis is dependent on the quality of the underlying financial data (so adjustments might be required to obtain a fair picture of the facts) and the information should always be seen in context of the general business cycle, industry cycle, developments, practices and sensitivities to seasonality, firm specific changes, the type of the business and its products or services, etc.

\(\bullet\) Financial ratio analysis can help to identify sources of weaknesses. However, the application always needs to consider the,,bigger picture". Simply aiming to maximize a ratio without being aware of potential trade-offs can be counter-productive with respect to other objectives. For instance, aiming to reduce working capital with the objective to minimize financing costs can cause sales and profitability to decline as the credit terms might constrain competitiveness.
