I review the properties and discuss some of the puzzling aspects of the unique binary system composed of the luminous hot subdwarf HD 49798 and a white dwarf with mass of 1.2 \(M_{\odot}\) and spin period of 13.2 s. This is one of the few massive white dwarfs with a dynamically measured mass and the one with the shortest spin period. It emits pulsed X-rays with a very soft spectrum, powered by accretion from the tenuous stellar wind of its companion of sdO spectral type. The current level of mass accretion cannot provide enough angular momentum to explain the small, but precisely measured, spin-up rate of 72 nanoseconds per year, which is instead best interpreted as the result of the radial contraction of this young white dwarf. The higher mass transfer rate expected during the future evolutionary stages of HD 49798 will drive the white dwarf above the Chandrasekhar limit, but the final fate, a type Ia SN explosion or the collapse to a millisecond pulsar, is uncertain.

## 1 Introduction

The bright blue star HD 49798 first attracted the interest of astronomers in the sixties owing to the peculiarities of its spectrum with prominent helium and nitrogen lines and showing radial velocity variations, which indicated the presence of a companion star [1]. It was also noticed that its high galactic latitude (b=19\({}^{\circ}\)) implied a distance above the Galactic disk unusually large for a main sequence OB star.

A few years later, radial velocity measurements [2] confirmed the binary nature of HD 49798 with the discovery of its orbital period (1.55 days) and the determination of the mass function (0.27 \(M_{\odot}\)). However, no spectral or photometric signs of a second star could be found, implying a faint low mass companion, such as a red dwarf or, possibly, a white dwarf. In 1994, the optical mass function was measured with higher precision [3] (0.263\(\pm\)0.004 \(M_{\odot}\)), but all the attempts to reveal the invisible companion of this single-lined spectroscopic binary were unsuccessful.

The mystery of the companion star was solved, at least partially, when soft X-ray emission with a highly significant periodicity at 13.2 s was discovered [4] from the \(ROSAT\) source RX J0648.0-4418, positionally coincident with HD 49798. This rapid periodicity can only be explained by the rotation of either a neutron star (NS) or a white dwarf (WD). In both cases, the expected optical emission from these compact stars is much fainter than that of the much larger star HD 49798, and thus very difficult (or impossible) to be seen in optical photometric or spectral data.

Renewed interest in the HD 49798/RX J0648.0-4418 binary was prompted bythe measurement of the X-ray mass function, obtained through the timing analysis of the X-ray pulsations. This led to the determination of the masses of the two binary components, \(M_{HD}\) = 1.50 \(M_{\odot}\) and \(M_{X}\) = 1.28 \(M_{\odot}\) for the subdwarf and its companion, respectively [5]. As discussed in Sec. 4, there are now several arguments indicating that the companion of HD 49798 is a massive WD, with interesting implications for the future evolution of this system (Sec. 5).

## 2 Properties of HD 49798

HD 49798 (also known as CD-44 2920) is a bright blue star (B\(-\)V=\(-\)0.27) with apparent magnitude m\({}_{V}\)=8.27, located in the southern sky (R.A.= 6\({}^{h}\) 48\({}^{m}\) 4.7\({}^{s}\), Dec.=\(-\)44\({}^{\circ}\) 18\({}^{\prime}\) 58.4\({}^{\prime\prime}\), J2000). Early estimates indicated a distance of 650 pc, while the recent measurements obtained with Gaia [6] give \(d\)=521\(\pm\)14 pc. Despite the slight downward revision of its distance, HD 49798 is still the most luminous known subdwarf of O spectral type (sdO), with an absolute magnitude of \(M_{V}\)=\(-\)0.24 and a bolometric luminosity of 4.4\(\times\)10\({}^{3}\)\(L_{\odot}\).

A first application of non-LTE atmospheric models to the spectrum of HD 49798 yielded an effective temperature of \(T_{eff}\) = 47500\(\pm\)2000 K and a surface gravity log\(g\) = 4.25\(\pm\)0.2. The overabundance of helium, that equals hydrogen in number (X\({}_{H}\)=0.19 and X\({}_{He}\)=0.78), was also confirmed [7].

More recently, accurate values for the element abundances and for the stellar parameters of HD 49798 were obtained with the analysis of high-resolution optical and UV spectra [8] (see Table 1 for some of these parameters). Note that the HD 49798 mass derived from this atmosphere modelling is consistent with the dynamically determined value.

A particularly interesting property of HD 49798, in view of the X-ray emission from this binary, is the presence of a radiatively driven stellar wind, as it is clearly indicated by the P-Cygni profiles of nitrogen lines [9]. The most recent estimates [8], that take into account the peculiar abundances of HD 49798, give a mass loss rate of 2.1\(\times\)10\({}^{-9}\)\(M_{\odot}\) yr\({}^{-1}\) and a wind terminal velocity \(v_{w}\)=1570 km s\({}^{-1}\). This wind provides the matter that produces the accretion-powered X-rays from the compact star. In addition, the stellar wind is also responsible for the X-ray emission from HD 49798 itself [10], which is clearly visible, with a luminosity \(L_{X}\sim 2\times 10^{30}\) erg s\({}^{-1}\), only when the hot subdwarf eclipses the much brighter X-ray flux emitted by its compact companion. The relevance of HD 49798 in the context of the study of the weak winds of early type subdwarfs [11] is discussed in Ref. 12.

## 3 X-ray properties

X-ray emission from the direction of HD 49798 was seen for the first time with the _Einstein Observatory_ in March 1979, but the small number of counts in the HRI instrument (0.05-4 keV) prevented a detailed analysis. The source was later observed with the _EXOSAT_ satellite, but the detection in the CMA instrument was severely contaminated by the strong ultraviolet emission from HD 49798.

massive WD and the composition of HD 49798 (this is the expected composition of the atmosphere, because the WD is accreting matter from the subdwarf's wind). This model describes well the soft spectral component, with a best fit with effective temperature \(T_{eff}=2.2\times 10^{5}\) K. However, the limited bandwidth and energy resolution of the available data did not allow us to obtain a univocal solution. In fact, only slightly worse fits were obtained with \(T_{eff}=2.9\times 10^{5}\) K and \(T_{eff}=3.7\times 10^{5}\) K. The most interesting result of this analysis is that the size of the emission region inferred with the WD atmosphere model (\(\sim\)1600 km, \(\sim\)400 km, and \(\sim\)66 km, for the three values of \(T_{eff}\)) are much larger than that obtained using a simple blackbody to describe the thermal emission.

The soft X-ray emission is modulated near the eclipse ingress and egress by the absorption caused by the wind material (Fig. 2). These variations can be well modelled by adopting the correct composition of the wind [8]. Contrary to the typical behaviour of accretion-powered X-ray sources, the X-ray luminosity has remained at the same level in all the observations, except for a small flux variation (less than a factor two) in the power law component, in data taken 6 years apart [16].

Figure 2: Light curve of the X-ray eclipse compared with two models of absorption in the wind of HD 49798. The models have been computed by integrating the column density along the line of sight at different orbital phases, assuming solar abundances (blue line) and the abundances of HD 49798 derived in Ref. 8.

## 4 White dwarf or neutron star?

Both a NS and a WD are compatible with the measured mass and spin period3 of the compact companion of HD 49798. The main arguments to discriminate between the two possibilities are based on three properties: _i)_ X-ray luminosity, _ii)_ spin period evolution _iii)_ size of X-ray emitting region.

Footnote 3: a period of 13.2 s, although the fastest observed in a WD, is still a factor \(\sim\)3 larger than the break-up value for such a massive WD [17].

While initial estimates of the X-ray luminosity were affected by the uncertainties on the distance and on the spectral parameters, the accurate Gaia parallax and the high quality _XMM-Newton_ spectrum [13, 14], imply a precise value of \(L_{X}=(1.3\pm 0.3)\times 10^{32}\) erg s\({}^{-1}\). Given that the radius of HD 49798 is much smaller than that of its Roche-lobe (\(R_{RL}\sim 3~{}~{}R_{\odot}\)), accretion onto the compact object can occur only through capture of the stellar wind. In this case we can estimate an accretion rate of \(\dot{M}=(R_{\rm A}/2a)^{2}\dot{M}_{\rm w}\), where \(a\)= 7.8 \(~{}R_{\odot}\) is the orbital separation and \(R_{\rm A}\) is the Bondi-Hoyle accretion radius. The latter depends on the relative velocity between the wind and the accreting object, \(v=(v_{w}^{2}+v_{orb}^{2})^{1/2}\sim v_{w}\). If this matter reaches the surface of a star with mass \(M\) and radius \(R\), we expect a luminosity

\[L_{\rm X}=\frac{GM}{R}\,\frac{R_{\rm A}^{2}}{4a^{2}}\dot{M}_{\rm w}=\frac{(GM )^{3}}{R~{}a^{2}~{}v_{w}^{4}}\dot{M}_{\rm w}\] (1)

Taking \(\dot{M}_{\rm w}=2\times 10^{-9}~{}~{}M_{\odot}\) yr\({}^{-1}\), \(v_{w}=1500\) km s\({}^{-1}\), and radii of 3000 km and 12 km, respectively in the WD and NS case, Eq. 1 gives \(L_{\rm X}^{\rm WD}=1.2\times 10^{31}\) erg s\({}^{-1}\) and \(L_{\rm X}^{\rm NS}=3.0\times 10^{33}\) erg s\({}^{-1}\), These luminosities are, respectively, lower and higher than the observed value.

However, the presence of a rotating magnetosphere that interacts with the accreting plasma can lead to more complex scenarios yielding different luminosities [18]. As discussed in detail in Ref. 13 and illustrated in Fig. 3, a reduced NS luminosity, consistent with the observed value, can be attained only in the sub-sonic propeller regime and if the NS has a magnetic field of \(\sim\)10\({}^{11}\) G. However, in this regime a pulsed fraction much smaller than the observed one is expected and, more importantly, it is impossible to explain the spin-up. On the other hand, in case of a WD, Eq. 1 gives a luminosity in agreement with the observed one for a wind velocity \(v_{w}\sim 800\) km s\({}^{-1}\). Although this values is smaller than the terminal wind velocity inferred from optical/UV studies (see Table 1), it is possible that the wind velocity close to the WD is reduced due to the photoionisation produced by the X-ray emission [19].

A WD interpretation is also favoured by the time evolution of the spin period. Compact objects in X-ray binaries experience spin-up due to the angular momentum carried by the accreting material. However, both in the NS and WD case, the accretion rate in this system is too small to produce the observed spin-up rate,even in the most favourable condition of accretion through a disk[4]. Also the great stability of the spin-up rate over three decades, is at variance with the irregular variations typically seen in the period derivatives of wind-accreting systems. A solution of this puzzle is naturally provided if the compact object is a relatively young WD, still in the radial contracting phase[20]. The change in the moment of inertia for a WD of 1.2 \(M_{\odot}\) and age between one and five millions of years gives a spin period time derivative in full agreement with the observed one. Such a range of WD ages is consistent with the evolutionary scenarios proposed to explain this binary system (see Sec. 5).

To discriminate between a WD and a NS, one can also consider the size of the emission region derived from the spectral fit of the soft spectral component, although this is clearly a model-dependent inference. The blackbody model gives a radius of \(\sim\)40 km, while fits with a WD atmosphere model yield much larger radii (Sec. 3). These dimensions are too large for a hot spot on the surface of a NS, but are reasonable values in the WD case.

Figure 3: - (From Ref. 13) – The left panel shows the magnetospheric radius as a function of magnetic field for a NS or a WD (bottom and top scale, respectively). The different regimes depend on the relative dimensions of various characteristic radii: the light-cylinder radius \(R_{\rm LC}=cP/2\pi\simeq 6.3\times 10^{10}\,\)cm, the accretion radius \(R_{\rm A}=2G\pi G\pi/v_{\rm w}^{2}\simeq 1.3\times 10^{10}\,\)cm (for \(v_{\rm w}=1570\,\)km\(\,\)s\({}^{-1}\)), and the correlation radius \(R_{\rm co}=(G\pi B^{2}/4\pi^{2})^{1/3}\simeq 9.0\times 10^{8}\,\)cm. The orbital separation \(a\simeq 5.4\times 10^{11}\,\)cm, the WD radius \(R_{\rm WD}=3580\,\)km and the NS radius \(R_{\rm NS}=12\,\)km are also indicated. The two right panels show the X-ray luminosities expected in the different regimes. The observed value \(L_{\rm X}=(1.3\pm 0.3)\times 10^{32}\,\)erg\(\,\)s\({}^{-1}\) is indicated (with its uncertainty as a grey horizontal band). Solid lines refer to \(v_{\rm w}=1570\,\)km\(\,\)s\({}^{-1}\), while the dashed lines to \(v_{\rm w}=800\,\)km\(\,\)s\({}^{-1}\).

## 5 Evolution

The low H abundance indicates that HD 49798 is the stripped core of an initially much more massive and larger star. Also the N overabundance and the low abundances of C and O confirm that its surface layers once belonged to the outer part of the H-burning core of a massive star. Slightly different evolutionary scenarios have been proposed to explain this system, that clearly passed through a common envelope phase.

HD 49798 could be the descendent of a fairly massive progenitor that began to fill its Roche-lobe before He ignition and is currently in a core He-burning phase [7, 21]. The mass of the He star can then be related [22] to that of its progenitor by M\({}_{He}\)=0.043 M\({}^{1.67}\), implying an initial mass of \(\sim\)8 \(M_{\odot}\). Alternatively, HD 49798 could consist of a degenerate CO core, surrounded by a helium envelope with a He-burning shell at its base [23]. In this scenario, it would be the core of a progenitor of \(\sim\)5 \(M_{\odot}\) that suffered mass loss during a common envelope event when it was on the early asymptotic giant branch. Both scenarios imply that the WD in this system is much younger than those found in cataclysmic variables.

Also the future evolution of this system, in which a massive WD is accreting He-rich material, is interesting and it has been discussed by several authors. The current mass transfer onto the WD is not changing significantly its mass, but it will greatly increase when, about 65,000 yrs from now [24], HD 49798 expands and fills its Roche-lobe. This will produce a high X-ray luminosity, possibly with the presence of bright outbursts and the formation of a super-soft X-ray source, and also possibly leading to important variations in the WD mass.

Evolutionary computations [25] indicate that the WD will reach the Chandrasekhar limit after only a few \(10^{4}\) years of Roche-lobe overflow, during which \(\sim\)(5-6)\(\times 10^{-6}\)\(M_{\odot}\) yr\({}^{-1}\) of He-rich matter are steadily converted to C and O, while the unburned matter is ejected by the system trough an optically thick wind. The final fate of the WD depends on other critical factors such as, e.g., its composition and final rotational velocity.

If HD 49798 hosts a CO WD, it could be the progenitor of an over-luminous type Ia supernova, since the fast rotation can increase the mass stability limit above the value for non-rotating stars. Massive WDs are expected to have an ONe composition, but again the high spin might play a role here, since it can lead to the formation of CO WDs even for high masses [26]. The fact that this system originated from a pair of relatively massive stars (\(\sim\)8-9 \(M_{\odot}\)) might suggest that it could be the progenitor of a type Ia supernova with a short delay time. However, the delay time might be considerably longer if the explosion has to await that the WD spins down [27].

Considering its high mass, it is more likely that the companion of HD 49798 is an ONe WD. In this case an accretion-induced collapse might occur, leading to the formation of a NS. The high spin rate and low magnetic field make this WD an ideal progenitor of a millisecond pulsar. This evolutionary scenario could providean alternative path for the direct formation of millisecond pulsars, not involving the recycling of old pulsars in accreting low-mass X-ray binaries.

The future evolution of this system in the case that the compact object is a NS has been explored in Ref. 24. According to these authors, HD 49798/RX J0648.0-4418 could pass in a phase of high accretion rate appearing as an ultra luminous X-ray source [28], and then produce either a binary or an isolated millisecond pulsar.

## 6 Fast rotation and magnetic field

The companion of HD 49798 is the WD with the shortest spin period currently known. A few other fast rotating WDs have been discovered in recent years (see Table 2). All of them are in cataclysmic variables, old systems in which the WD has been spun-up during a long phase of disk accretion. On the other hand, the origin of the rapid rotation of the HD 49798 companion is unclear. HD 49798/RX J0648.0-4418 is a young system, originating from intermediate mass stars, that passed through a common-envelope phase [22]. The current transfer of angular momentum is very small. Unless the WD was directly born with a short period, the spin-up must have occurred either before or during the common envelope phase. Given the short duration and complex dynamics of this phase, it is more likely that the spin-up occurred when the subdwarf was close to fill its Roche-lobe, just before the ensuing of the common-envelope phase and with the formation of an accretion disk.

If the accretion disk extends down to the star's surface, as it is expected for a weakly magnetised WD, short periods can be easily reached thanks to the high specific angular momentum carried by the accreting matter. Interestingly, some indication on the strength of the magnetic field can be derived considering the constraints illustrated in Fig. 3 for the different regimes of interaction between the rotating magnetosphere and the surrounding plasma. As discussed in Refs. 5,13, the strong X-ray pulsations and the observed luminosity imply a magnetic dipole field below a few \(10^{3}\) G, otherwise the WD would be in the propeller state. If the

## 7 Conclusions

Many binaries composed of a WD and a hot subdwarf of B spectral type are known[38, 39], but no accretion powered X-rays have been detected in these systems[40, 41, 42, 43]. Thus, HD 49798/RX J0648.0-4418 is the only known accretion-powered X-ray binary in which the mass donor is a hot subdwarf. Furthermore, both components of this binary do not share the typical properties of their respective classes: the WD is particularly massive and has a high spin frequency (though it is weakly magnetic), the hot subdwarf has a high luminosity, a relatively low surface gravity and peculiar abundances. These properties make HD 49798/RX J0648.0-4418 particularly interesting, not only in the context of stellar evolution models, but also for the study of hot subdwarfs and WDs in general. For example, it is possibly the first observed example of a young WD still in the phase of contraction. It is also a laboratory to investigate the weak stellar winds of hot subdwarfs, since the orbiting WD acts as a probe of the wind properties. Future multi-wavelength observations can bring very useful information and help to solve some of the still open questions, such as, e.g., the origin of the fast spin and the peculiar spectral/timing properties of the X-ray emission. In a more distant future, the presence of a fast rotating massive WD might also lead to the detection of gravitational waves caused by asymmetries in the mass distribution caused by accretion or by magnetic deformation[44].
